# Checklistr 

I am currently building Checklistr (MVP phase), a "checklist" app that allows users to keep track of whatever they want!

Right after my bootcamp was over I decided I wanted to further enhance my skills and learn <b>React</b> and <b>Spring Boot</b>. And I did! However I have always been curious about how authentication and authorization systems work, so it seemed like a great opportunity to also learn <b>Spring Security</b> and <b>JWT</b>. It took me a little over 2 weeks to learn those skills on my own and get the app from zero to the MVP phase.

## Usage

1. Clone the Server and the Client repositories:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/miguelvaladas/Checklistr-Client.git
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/miguelvaladas/Checklistr-Server.git
```

2. On the root of your client repository run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

3. On the root of your server repository run*: 
```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

*For security reasons the application.properties file found in /resources is hidden. If you wish to run the api on your machine, you need to add an application.properties file with your settings.

## TechStack
Frontend: <b>React</b>, <b>Vite</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>.</br>
Backend: <b>Spring Boot</b>, <b>Spring Security</b>, <b>JWT</b>, <b>Hibernate</b> and <b>MySQL</b>.

## Considerations
I am currently looking for my first opportunity as a software developer and I'm passionate about both frontend and backend. If you are interested in my work, feel free to send me a message through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-valadas/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:airesvaladas@gmail.com">email</a>.

## NextSteps
There are a lot of things to complete within the app, which I intend to do in the next couple of weeks.
